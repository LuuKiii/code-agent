A simple framework for building agents that use large language models (LLMs) to automate basic tasks or interact with APIs. The project is intended as a starting point for experimenting with LLM-powered agents and includes example code for common use cases.

- Modular design for adding new agent behaviors
- Integrates with LLM APIs
- Example project "calculator" to test current agent behaviour and it's ability to use LLM for fixing code.

See the examples directory for usage instructions.
